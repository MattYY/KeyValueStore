/// KeyValueStore (store) is a simple key-value storage class that persists data asynchronously to
/// disk while providing a synchronous setter/getter interface. KeyValueStore also allows you
/// to easily create unique storage instances by passing in a `filePath` that is passed in during
/// class instantiation. This is convenient if you want to quickly switch preference states.
///
/// To maintain a synchronous interface but write to disk off the main thread an in-memory 
/// dictionary (`data`) is kept in sync with a backing plist file. This synchronization
/// commences once one of the `load` methods is called (load or load:) which is necessary precusor
/// for using the store. Conversely the `unload` can be used "empty" the in-memory storage object
/// to free up space in constrained situations.
///
/// That said, the intention of this class is to support a relatively small amount of key-value
/// pairs so consider other implementations if you find yourself needing to store thousands or
/// even hundreds of items.
