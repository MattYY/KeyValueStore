/// KeyValueStore (store) is a simple key-value storage class that persists data asynchronously to
/// disk while providing a synchronous setter/getter interface. Additionally KeyValueStore
/// Allows the sandboxing of instances based on a `filePath` that is passed in during class
/// instantiation. This enables one to create different stores for different users, for example.
///
/// To maintain a synchronous interface but write to disk off the main thread an in-memory 
/// dictionary (`data`) and a backing plist file are kept in a synchronized state. This
/// synchronization commences once one of the `load` methods are called (load or load:) and
/// is a necessary precusor for setting/getting data from the store.
///
/// The intention of this class is to support a relatively small amount of key-value pairs,
/// and to satisfy the requirements of most user preference needs. Be aware that this class
/// stores your pairs in an in-memory dictionary and could contribute to memory pressure if
/// an abundance of data is stored.  The `unload` method can be used to release this pressure
/// at the expense of the store becoming unusable until `load` is again called.
